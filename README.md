# Missiles Ohno Mod for Mindustry
With the new ballistic missile, you can nuke the enemies with various missile silos. (It's also my first mod) Please, if you have any suggestions for balance changes (I'm only gonna change build cost) or missiles, DM me in discord with #MEEP of Faith#7277 (Plase don't spam my DMs though).

## Factory
Adds a Ballistics Factory to create missiles to load various milos. Kinda expensive to run, so have fun with that.

## Silos (and version added)
#### Missile Silo (v1) - Fires basic missiles. These missiles travel slightly faster.
#### Air Mine Silo (v1) - Fires a missile that bursts into a field of air mines.

#### Anti-Air Silo (v1) - Fires much faster missiles that blast down flying enemies.
#### Splitter Silo (v1) - Fire missiles that split into multiple smaller missiles. Thrice.
#### Nuclear Silo (v1) - The destruction capable should be read from the name.

I sped it up a bit. It actually takes about 10 seconds to explode. The gif itself is actually old, as I've made the missile fly faster in a later update to it.
#### Incindiary Silo (v2) - Lower explosion damage radius, but sends liquid flames flying all over the place.
#### Virus Silo (v2) (Basically Made by SolarPH) - On collision, creates a swarm of annoying drones

## Plans
#### World Ender Silo (Will cost 11565 of all resources to build. Why 11565? Check the research cost.)
#### Impulse Silo (Minimal damage, insane knockback)
#### Nuclear Crawler
